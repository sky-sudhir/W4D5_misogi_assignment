That sounds very interesting. Tell me more about the pricing.,1
I don't think this is what we're looking for right now.,0
This really addresses our needs. Can we schedule a demo for next week?,1

"So, just to confirm, if we sign up today, we get the premium features?",1
The pricing is a bit out of our budget at the moment.,0
I'm impressed. What kind of support do you offer after implementation?,1
